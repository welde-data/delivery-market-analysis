# Delivery Market Analysis (Belgium)

The **Delivery Market Analysis** project explores trends, customer preferences, and market dynamics in Belgium’s food delivery industry. It focuses on the performance of three major platforms: **TakeAway**, **UberEats**, and **Deliveroo**.

Using real-world databases, the project delivers actionable insights for both **restaurant partners** and **consumers**. The goal is to support better strategic decisions, improve market positioning, and ultimately enhance the overall user experience.

## Project Highlights

- **Consumer Preferences:** Identifies top-rated restaurants across key food categories, helping users make more informed dining choices.  
- **Platform Comparisons:** Compares TakeAway, UberEats, and Deliveroo across pricing, delivery fees, and the overall **price-to-rating** relationship to highlight strengths and weaknesses.  
- **Regional Trends:** Analyzes geographic patterns across Belgium to uncover service gaps (“dead zones”) and local food preferences.
